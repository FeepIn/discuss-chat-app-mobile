## My experience
This is my first real app that I started developing back then, and now that I'm more experienced in Android development, I'm starting to realise my messy code, my non-architectural file managment.

So now, I've decided to refactor all the code into modern Android technologies such as MVVM architecture, Room, Retrofit, Kotlin, Coroutines, Navigation component and so on...And in the future, maybe I will again talk about my code and refactor my code into futur technologies because Android technologies (and Web technologies in general) move so fast, new libraries are emerging every month, new architectures for example I've recently discovered Jetpack Compose which will be, as I've heard from many developers, the new way of creating layouts..
